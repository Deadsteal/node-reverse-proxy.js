  These are simple tests which I run against my own webserver.

  They are designed to do two things:

    * Test that HTTP fetches of particular hosts receive contain
      some expected & static text.

    * Test that requests to particular pages will generate a 301
      HTTP-Redirection response to a particular virtual host.
