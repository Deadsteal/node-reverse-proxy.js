Tested with source-compiled versions of Node.js:

    Node.js v0.4.3
( ./configure --without-ssl --prefix=/opt/node && make && make install )


Introduction
------------

node-reverse-proxy is a simple reverse HTTP proxy, which is designed
to listen upon a public IP address, and redirect each incoming
request to a back-end server.

Due to node.jss' scalable event-based model this reverse-proxy server
can handle many many concurrent connections without the heavy-weight
resource usage of a larger solution such as Apache.


Features
--------

In addition to proxying incoming connections to remote HTTP servers,
on a per-vhost basis, this server can also rewrite requests before
they are proxied.

There are two ways that rewrites may be specified:

  * Either via regular expressions, in a simpilar fashion to
    Apache's mod_rewrite module.

  * Via Javascript callbacks, which allow more control.


Installation
------------

To install the software you need only have the node.js binary
installed upon your system, and the "node-reverse-proxy.js" file
located upon your filesystem.

Once you've created a suitable configuration file, perhaps consulting
the examples provided, you may launch your proxy via:

   node ./node-reverse-proxy.js --config ./rules.js

This will load the rules you've defined in the file "rules.js" and launch
the server appropriately.


Usage
-----

Simple use is demonstrated by the provided examples.  Further examples
will be provided in due course.



Bugs?
-----

  Please report bugs to the author, where they will be fixed as
 quickly as possible.
